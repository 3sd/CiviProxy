# Technical Requirements

There shouldn't be any requirements that any web hoster wouldn't comply with, but here they are:

 1. PHP 5.3+
 2. PHP PEAR (to install on Debian/Ubunto, run `apt-get install php-pear`)
 3. Read/write permissions on your webspace
 4. Reasonable amount of protection, i.e. only authorised users (you) can upload/download the files
 5. Ideally with it's own IP address (makes configuring the VPN easier)
